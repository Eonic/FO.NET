I seem to remember a FOP extension for doing this, so you might be able to find some code samples in Java that could be ported to FO.NET.</p>\r\n<p>Non-FO solutions are something else to look at. For example itextsharp will probably do form fields (or commercial components such as aspose).</p>\r\n<p>Hope this helps</p>\r\n<p>Mark</p>",
