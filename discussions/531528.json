I have started to trim out things in the code that would access the directory but this did not seem like the best solution, as I ran into it trying to get the system fonts, and those I will need.  I am hosting it on hostgator.com, (not my choice) but seems fine enough until I ran into this issue. Does anyone have any suggestions here?<br />\n",
